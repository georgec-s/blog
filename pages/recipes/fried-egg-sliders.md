  Tiny breakfast sliders, done fancy
servings: 2 sandwiches
prep: 10min
cook: 10min
ingredients:
  - name: eggs
    amount: 2
    measurement: large
  - name: cheese (swiss or gruyere)
    amount: 2
    measurement: slices
  - name: potato rolls (Martin's)
    amount: 2
    measurement: dinner-roll sized
  - name: bacon
    amount: 2
    measurement: slices
  - name: pickled onions and peppers
    amount: 1
    measurement: tablespoon
equipment:
  - name: cast-iron flat-top
    amount: 1
  - name: tongs
    amount: 1
  - name: silicone spatula
    amount: 1
steps:
  - Heat cast-iron flat top over medium heat
  - Separate eggs in to yolks and whites. Reserve whites and yolks separately from each other, and separately for each egg
  - Slice potato rolls in half. Place inside (cut part) of bottom half on cutting board, with the inside (cut part) of top half resting on top
  - Once heated, place bacon on heated cast-iron flat top and cook until crispy but not burnt
  - Remove bacon from heat, wrap in paper towels, and let sit
  - Place egg whites, one eggs worth at a time, on the cast-iron flat top and fry for about 3 minutes
  - Flip egg whites over, fold cheese in to square, and place on top of egg whites
  - Place potato rolls on top of cheese and let steam while cheese melts and eggs finish
  - After 3 minutes, with your spatula, pick up the eggs by pressing down on the top bun, sliding spatula underneath, and lifting up. Place egg sandwich on cutting board by taking the top of the roll and sliding the egg off the spatula by pressing between both halfs of the roll and placing bottom-roll down
  - Place egg yolks on on cast-iron flat top
  - Remove the top bun from the sandwiches, rip bacon in to quarters, and place one slice of bacon on each sandwich. Top the bacon with one half tablespoon of pickled onions and peppers per sandwich
  - After yolks are cooked to desired firmness (I recommend just cooked and still runny), gently pick the yolk up ensuring it doesn't break, and place it on top of the onions and peppers
  - Place bun on top, gently pressing down, breaking the yolks and allowing it to cascade over the sandwiches
